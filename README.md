# Microprocessors and Peripherals Course Repository

This repository contains lab experiments and assembly language codes developed as part of the **Microprocessors and Peripherals** course. The course focused on the **8086 microprocessor** and its interaction with various peripheral devices. The assembly programs were written and tested on an emulator to simulate real-world use cases.

## Contents

1. **Lab Experiments**:
    - Hands-on experiments demonstrating the key principles of microprocessor operation, including data handling, arithmetic operations, and peripheral interfacing.
    
2. **Assembly Language Codes**:
    - A collection of assembly programs for the 8086 microprocessor covering a wide range of applications:
      - Data transfer and manipulation
      - Arithmetic and logical operations
      - Stack and procedure handling
      - Interrupt handling and peripheral interfacing

## Topics Covered

- **8086 Architecture**: Understanding registers, flags, and memory segmentation.
- **Data Transfer Operations**: Move, load, and store instructions.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Logical Operations**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT.
- **Control Flow**: Jumps, loops, and conditionals.
- **Stack Operations**: PUSH, POP, CALL, RET, stack management.
- **Interrupts**: Handling software and hardware interrupts.
- **Peripheral Interfacing**: Interaction with I/O devices using ports and interrupt-driven I/O.
